README:
1. Data extracted from Yelp page:
   Business Name,
   Business-URL, 
   Phone-no.,
   Business-Address

2. Then, we go to the business url. Sometimes, a url is no longer valid, so a timeout feature has been implemented. And also, there is mechanism to catch any exception if occurs.

3. At the business page, I first look for the existence of contact-us page. if it exists I open that link, handling similar exceptions. 

4. At the contact-US page, following details are extracted:
   contact-us email-id,
   any other email id that might be present
   Extra weightage is given to email-ids having substrings 'contact' or 'about'

5. If contact-us page doesn't exist, a similar search is done on the main page

6. Threading is also used so that multiple connections to different web-pages can be established at the same time

7. Special care has been taken so that the program doesn't stop in any kind of circumstances. Even if the data is not clean enough.
